# Language Benchmark

This is a programming language benchmark project. I will include multiple types of algorithm to test different aspects of programming languages.

## Tests

1. Fibonacci Sequence (Brute Force)

## Project Structure

`benchmarks/<language>/<algorithm>` is the main folder structure for benchmark source code. The folder names will be used as IDs in database.

Input

```json


```

Output

```json
{
  "time": [
    { "input": 1, "time": 1000 },
    { "input": 2, "time": 2000 }
  ]
}
```
